	PLAYER interacts with a TOWNSPERSON.

MAX
Hey, /Player/. Didn't think you would be back so soon. Thaddeus is probably at his office still.


ALEX
Good evening, /Player/. I think Thaddeus is still at the center of town.

BENNY
Good to have you back, /Player/! Charlie's going to start pestering you with requests for stories, now that you're returned. It's late, but Thaddeus should still be in his office working.

CHARLIE
Hi, /Player/! How were the forests? 

TYLER
Good evening, /Player/. Glad to see you're back. Tommy's disappeared somewhere, but Thaddeus is in the center of town, still. 

TOMMY
Hey, /Player/. It's so dark outside.

Thaddeus Conversation 1
-- -- --
	PLAYER interacts with THADDEUS

THADDEUS
Ah, /Player/, good to see you. I heard that you were back in town from your expedition early, and am excited to hear about what you discovered. 

PLAYER
Good to see you, too, Mayor Thaddeus. 

THADDEUS
And your partner? Have they come back to town as well?

PLAYER
That's what I wanted to talk about. We ran into some, uh, issues around the outskirts.

THADDEUS
I saw the towers had been lit.

PLAYER
Yes. The storm that we were scouting turned out worse than either of us expected. 

THADDEUS
And the other lookout?

PLAYER
They didn't survive, Thaddeus. I'm not sure what happened, but the storm did it. Thunder and lightning and then their whole station cut out.

PLAYER
We still should have a few days at the pace the storm's been moving.

THADDEUS
Thank you. I'm still wrapped up here for a couple of hours, so I would appreciate your telling the other townspeople of what's going on. There's been some talk at the towers being lit, but they need to know the severity.

THADDEUS
And it'll be good since you've only been in town for a few weeks. A few folks might have some things for you to help them with, too--the other lookouts would help around town when they weren't scouting.

THADDEUS
But these people have know each other a long time, and they've built a community on trust. So show them you care, and they'll help you out however they can.

THADDEUS
When you're done, come back to me. I'll start thinking about how we'll get through this storm, and I'll have need of you. Good evening, /Player/.

PLAYER
Good evening, Mayor.

Max: Activate the Weather detectors
-- -- --
	PLAYER interacts with MAX.

MAX
Hey, /Player/. How are you doing?

PLAYER
I'm good, Max. Just wanted to let you know that there's a pretty big storm headed this way. Nothing to be concerned about yet, Thaddeus just wanted everyone to have a heads-up.

MAX
I figured something was off when the towers lit up. Haven't seen that in a few years.

MAX
So it's a storm you say? Well, if you find yourself afield soon, it might help us to have more data. There's a grid of sensors that have been dead for a few years outside town, but it shouldn't take much to get them running.

PLAYER
I'll look into it, then.

MAX
Thanks. Again, you should just need a spark to get them going. Have a good night.

Tyler: Find Tommy
-- -- --
	DEFAULT
PLAYER interacts with TYLER and has not talked to TOMMY.

PLAYER
Hey, Tyler. How's it going?

TYLER
I'm fine. Thanks for stopping by to say hello, but I'm looking for Tommy.

PLAYER
This won't take long, but Thaddeus wanted me to let you know that there's a storm heading toward town. It's why we lit the towers.

TYLER
Oh, I didn't notice. Must've been just a few hours ago.

PLAYER
Yeah. Nothing to worry about for now, but just be aware.

TYLER
Okay. Thank you. Well, if you're going around town, do you think that you could help look for Tommy? It's been a couple hours and I have no clue where they are.

PLAYER
I'll keep an eye out and tell them to head home.

TYLER
Thank you, /Player/. Have a good evening.

	CHECK-IN
	PLAYER interacts with TYLER after taking the quest.

TYLER
Good to see you again. Have you heard from Tommy yet?

ALT. (Tommy found first)
	PLAYER interacts with TYLER and has already talked to TOMMY.

PLAYER
Hey, Tyler. How's it going?

TYLER
I'm fine. Thanks for stopping by to say hello, but I'm looking for Tommy.

PLAYER
Oh! I saw him playing earlier by Town Hall. He asked me to look for a stuffed animal for him.

TYLER
Oh, great, okay. Can you tell him that they should come home before the sun sets? 

PLAYER
Yeah, of course.

TYLER
Thank you so much. Though I'm assuming you didn't stop by to hear me ask about Tommy's whereabouts?

PLAYER
Yeah, Thaddeus wanted me to stop by and let you know that there's a storm heading toward town. It's why we lit the towers.

TYLER
Oh, I didn't notice. It must've happened when I was looking for Tommy.

PLAYER
Yeah. Nothing to worry about for now, but just be aware.

TYLER
Okay, thanks for letting me know. Have a good evening!

ON FINISH
	PLAYER interacts with TYLER and has told TOMMY to return.

PLAYER
Hey, Tyler. Wanted to check in and see if Tommy's returned yet.

TYLER
Yeah, they arrived a few minutes ago. Thank you so much.

TOMMY
Hi, /Player/!

PLAYER
Good to see that you're home safe, Tommy. Have a great night.

PLAYER interacts with TOMMY and hasn't talked to TYLER.

TOMMY
Hey, /Player/!

PLAYER
Hey, Tommy! What are you doing out here by yourself?

TOMMY
I lost my stuffed rabbit and can't find it.

PLAYER
Sorry, kid. Is it around here somewhere?

TOMMY
I think so. Do you think you could help?

PLAYER
I can keep an eye out for it.

TOMMY
Thank you! Have a good night.

PLAYER
Good to see you, too, Tommy.

ALT. (Tyler talked to first)
	PLAYER interacts with TOMMY and has talked to TYLER.

TOMMY
Hey, /Player/!

PLAYER
Hey, Tommy! You know that Tyler's looking for you. What are you doing out here by yourself?

TOMMY
I lost my stuffed rabbit and can't find it.

PLAYER
Sorry, kid. But you really should get going home. It's getting late.

TOMMY
I don't want to go home without my rabbit.

PLAYER
Is it around here somewhere?

TOMMY
I think so. Do you think you could help?

PLAYER
I can keep an eye out for it.

TOMMY
Thank you! Have a good night.

PLAYER
Good to see you, too, Tommy.

CHECK-IN
	PLAYER interacts with TOMMY after taking the quest.


TYLER
Hey, /Player/! Have you found my rabbit yet?

ON FINISH
	PLAYER interacts with TOMMY and has found the stuffed animal.

PLAYER
Hey, Tommy! Guess what I found!

TOMMY
My rabbit! Thank you so much!


PLAYER
Of course, kid.

	GO HOME
	PLAYER interacts with TOMMY, has talked to TYLER, and has found the stuffed animal.
	Segue from ON FINISH if possible.

PLAYER
Now that you've found the rabbit, will you come home? Remember, Tyler's been looking for you all afternoon.

TOMMY
Okay. I'll head there.

PLAYER
Thanks, Tommy. You're a good kid. Get home safe.

Charlie: Lightning Bottle
-- -- --

CHARLIE
Hey, /Player/! You're back early.

PLAYER
Hey, Charlie. How're you doing?

CHARLIE
I'm good! Max has been teaching me and Charlie a lot of things. 

PLAYER
That's great. Well, I don't know if you've heard already, but there's a storm that should hit in a few days, so you two should be careful playing outside, alright?

CHARLIE
Okay, we will. But I wish that I could go see it up close like you. It seems so cool! And I could learn so many things from it, like how lightning works, or how rain clouds develop.

PLAYER
That would be fun, Charlie, but it's not safe. You can still learn all that from Max, indoors.

CHARLIE
I know. But if you go out there again, could you catch lightning for me?

PLAYER
What?

CHARLIE
Yeah! I have this bottle-device that Tommy and I made awhile ago. You just need to set it near something that attracts lightning and -- zap! -- it'll catch it.

PLAYER
Interesting. Well, I'll see what I can do next time I'm in the field.

CHARLIE
Thank you so much! This is going to be so cool!

Post-Thaddeus Conversations

MAX
Hey, /Player/. Thanks again for the heads up about the storm, and let me know how activating the detectors goes. Can't wait to see their data.

ALEX
Hey, /Player/. Thanks for letting me know. You can never prepare enough, you know? Whatever happens, I'm gonna come through it on my feet. Just got to get preparing in the meantime.

BENNY
Thanks for stopping by, /Player/. I'm not too worried about this storm, though. We've seen worse. I'll try to keep Charlie inside. They're really intrigued by the entire situation, if you can imagine it.

CHARLIE
Hi! I can't wait to see more of the storm. Through my window, though. And I can't wait to see my lightning-in-a-bottle!

TYLER
Thanks for finding Tommy, again. And for letting us know about the storm.

TOMMY
Hi, /Player/! Thank you for finding my rabbit. See you later!

Thaddeus Conversation 2
-- -- --

THADDEUS
Good to see you back, /Player/. I've taken it that you've made the rounds since you've come back. Well, to business then. Since the incident at the Lookout Tower was caused by the storm, we think that we would be best served by your investigating it.

PLAYER
Is there anything specific I should be looking for?

THADDEUS
We're not entirely sure. But as long as you can get to the Tower and see if there's anything informative about the area, that will be enough.

PLAYER
I'll set off at once, then.

THADDEUS
Great. But if there are things you need to do for people in town, you should finish those up. I'm not sure how long you'll be gone, and people can be impatient.

PLAYER
Noted.

THADDEUS
The path back to the Tower is on the far east of town. Hopefully you'll be able to find answers there.
