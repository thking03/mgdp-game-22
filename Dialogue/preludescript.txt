    PLAYER walks to LOOKOUT.

LOOKOUT
Hey, /Player/. Good to see you. Glad you got my message.

PLAYER
What's happening? You said you saw something to the west?

LOOKOUT
Yeah. The clouds on the horizon seem darker than the thunderheads above us right now. I'm not sure what's going on yet, but they don't look good.

PLAYER
Any word from the town?

LOOKOUT
Not yet. They probably don't know. 

LOOKOUT
Anyway, I wanted you here because I needed someone to light the warning towers. We don't want anyone getting caught in whatever's coming, and I've got to stay here to monitor everything.

PLAYER
Got it. I'll radio when it's done.

LOOKOUT
Thanks, kid. See you on the other side, then.

	PLAYER activates the last tower.

PLAYER
It's gotten chillier since I left, but that's the last one lit. 

	Radio static. Wind through the receiver.

PLAYER
This is /Player/, calling in. Warning towers are lit, and I'm headed back to the Lookout. Over.


LOOKOUT
Roger, kid. But head back into town. It's getting dicey out here and you've been out for a week.

PLAYER
You sure you'll be fine by yourself?

LOOKOUT
I've been monitoring this land for twice as long as you've been alive. No need to worry about me.

PLAYER
Fine. But I'm coming out first thing in the morning.

LOOKOUT
Of course, kid, I wouldn't expect anything less. G'night. I'll see you in the--

Through the receiver, a crash of thunder, splintering wood and metal. When the sound fades, only ringing and intense static.

PLAYER
What's going on?

LOOKOUT
Worse than -- thought -- go back and tell Mayor -- 

PLAYER
I'm not leaving you out there. I can be there in thirty minutes and then--

LOOKOUT
No, kid, let me -- make sure you tell -- worse --

	The receiver goes dead. Silence.
