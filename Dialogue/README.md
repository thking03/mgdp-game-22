# DIALOGUE for MGDP 22

This dialogue folder lives outside of our game's Unity environment. It contains the complete plaintext, as well as helper functions developed to transform it into a readable format to Unity. All scripts associated with dialogue in the game are inside of the Unity folder (`MGDP 22`).

Changes to the dialogue text should primarily occur in this folder once the first draft is uploaded.
